- This Framework & Strategy are still experimental and under heavy development. It is not recommended running it live at this moment.
- Always make sure to understand & test your MoniGoMani configuration until you trust it, before even thinking about going live!
- I am in no way responsible for your live results! You are always responsible for your own MoniGoMani configuration!
