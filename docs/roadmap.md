# Planned

## Roadmap

MoniGoMani's planned section lives under the [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/issues) section!
*(Don't be scared GitHub likes to pick bad names for things, but also don't abuse this for common questions though!)*
This is where we'll keep track of all **New Feature, Feature Enhancements and BugFixes** and it should be the ideal place to follow the status of the project more in depth or to contribute more directly towards it! :handshake:
