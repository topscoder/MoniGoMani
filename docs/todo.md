# `mgm-hurry` ToDo

- [ ] Add these TODO's as GitHub issues and remove this file. Period.
- [x] Cleanup code and docs
- [x] Implement check method which checks for freqtrade, mgm and config existence
- [x] Check if freqtrade was installed already and warn user it will be overwritten AND settings will get lost
- [x] Let `download_static_pairlist` ask to write it automagically to `mgm-config.json`
- [ ] Make setting up frequi possible
- [ ] Implement logging modes (debug, info, default)
- [x] Implement some movement in CLI at time consuming tasks. It sometimes looks like nothing happens, but it does!
